	<h1>Treading in Complexity -  A Microbiome Oriented Blog</h1>
	<p>"You inherit your environment just as much as your genes" - <em>Johnny Rich, The Human Script</em>

	In all honesty, I think this quote perfectly summarizes the complexity of studying the bacterial microbiome and
	how it interacts with it's human host.  Just when you think you have it figured out a new variable or confounder

	tread and pop my head out above the unknown....
