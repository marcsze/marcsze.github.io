	<p>Hi there! First, thank you for visiting the site and taking an interest in who I am
	and what I do. For those of you that may have stumbled upon this site by accident my name is Marc Sze 
	and I study the bacterial microbiome. At the present time I'm best known for the lung microbiome research that I completed
	at the <em>University of British Columbia</em>. I've recently migrated to the <em>University of Michigan</em> to study stool 
	and GI microbiomes. This section of my site is dedicated to explaining how I got started, got interested in, and ultimately trapped in trying to pursue scientific 
	research as a viable career for the past 8 years and counting. If you could care less about this story feel free to skip 
	ahead and directly access my CV for the <a href="/cv">point form version</a>.</p>

	<h1>Undergraduate Research: Point Counting and Quantitative Histology</h1>
	
	
	<p>I think it is a testament to the enthusiasm and passion my summer resaerch supervisors had that I did not quit
	science after going through 4 months of quantitative histology.  What was so problematic with this process you may ask?
	Well, I first processed close to 1500 images and then after this imaging I had to manually count, based on a grid, 
	how many positive pixels versus tissue pixels there were in the image. I'm pretty sure there was one day where I 
	fell asleep at the microscope.  </p>
