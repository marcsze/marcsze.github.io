This is a test of how the blog posting system works. 
I want to be able to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to do this. 
this way I can use Markdown to create posts. So far it has been easier to put
the bare bones down thanks to this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)
by Jonathan McGlone.
