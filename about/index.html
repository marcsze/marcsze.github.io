	<p>Hi there! First, thank you for visiting the site and taking an interest in who I am
	and what I do. For those of you that may have stumbled upon this site by accident my name is Marc Sze 
	and I study the bacterial microbiome. At the present time I'm best known for the lung microbiome research that I completed
	at the <em>University of British Columbia</em>. Now I've migrated to stool and GI microbiomes. This section of my site is
	dedicated to explaining how I got started, get interested in, and ultimately trapped in trying to pursue scientific 
	research for the last 8 years and counting. If you could care less about this story feel free to skip directly to 
	my CV for the point form <a href="/cv">version</a>. </p>
