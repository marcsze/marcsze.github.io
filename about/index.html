	<p>Hi there, I'm Marc Sze. I study the bacterial microbiome and 
	I'm best known for lung microbiome research at the <em>University of British Columbia</em>. 
	Now I've migrated to stool and GI microbiomes. I am currently working on getting 
	this blog up and running. I apologize if not all the links work properly. <a href="/about">Read more about my work...</a></p>
